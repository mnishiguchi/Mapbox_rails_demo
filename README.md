### Open Street Maps vs Google Maps

#### Open Street Maps
- open-source
- a Wikipedia-like model
- a free, editable map of the world
- made entirely by the voluntary efforts of online masses
- every edit you make to OSM is owned by you and the community
- the flexibility, e.g., styling

#### Google Maps
- closed-source
- every change you make to Google Mapsâ€¦ will be owned by Google
- Google is an advertising company
